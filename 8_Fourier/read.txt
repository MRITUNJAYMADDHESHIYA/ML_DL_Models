The Fourier Transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that transforms a signal (or function) from the time domain into the frequency domain.

Uses of Fourier Transform:-
Signal Processing
Noise reduction
Filtering (low-pass, high-pass, etc.)
Compression (e.g., MP3, JPEG)

Engineering & Physics
Solving differential equations
Analyzing vibrations and waves

Quantum mechanics (wave functions)
Medical Imaging
MRI scans use Fourier transforms to reconstruct images from raw data.

Communication Systems
Modulation/demodulation in radios, Wi-Fi, and 5G
Spectrum analysis

Image Processing
Edge detection, pattern recognition, watermarking
